Datasets
Here are some datasets that were used in various places in SAFD.

The adjusted closing prices listed in these datasets are not current. They are the adjusted prices as of the date when the data were downloaded.

Most of these datasets were downloaded from Yahoo Finance.

    Intel Corporation; daily OHLC, first 3 quarters, 2017 INTCd20173Q.csv
    Intel Corporation; daily OHLC, 1987 through 2017 INTCd.csv

A CSV dataset can be read directly into an R data frame by a statement of the form

url <- "http://mason.gmu.edu/~jgentle/books/statfinbk/Data/INTCd20173Q.csv"
INTC20173Q <- read.csv(url, header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
