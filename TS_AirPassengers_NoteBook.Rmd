Seasonality Plot âˆ’ Air Passengers

```

A repeating pattern within each year is known as a - Seasonal Variation , or seasonality .   
This is true even if the period is not a year - seasonality can be within a time span of a month also.   
   
   QUOTE - Random or stochastic trends are common in Financial TimeSeries -    
   thus Regression model is not appropriate for Fin TS . Further forecating is based   
   on extrapolation (assumption that existing trends will continue )   
   Also in absence of external shock - the linear trend can be easily extrapolated.  
   Outliers are to be managed - robust methods of fitting models and imputation  
   of missing values may be used .- UNQUOTE
